A Quantum Sensing & Quantum Machine Learning solution harnessing blue energy at oceanic confluences, by predicting ideal flow rates with sustainable gradients for clean energy

## Problem Statement

Blue Energy is a vast untapped energy potential, most potent where rivers meet the ocean ~1300 locations. Our goal is to optimize non-invasive blue energy plants using quantum sensing and quantum recurrent neural networks to maximize power production based on environmental conditions in the fresh and salt water.  
## Code 
QNN.ipynb contains our QRNN model, which generates sample quantum and classical sensor data, then trains on the data to predict optimal efficiency conditions.
